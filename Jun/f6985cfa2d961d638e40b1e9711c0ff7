His creative and innovative methods of demystifying Mathematics are excellent and well received by learners and teachers. “As South Africans, we need to inspire a special type of thinking and generate ideas to make our learners not only love Maths but also be inspired by its endless possibilities. I am committed to doing this but I cannot achieve it alone because realising this vision requires finances, skills and innovation so I am appealing to anyone who wants to be part of encouraging creativity in Basic Education to contribute to this cause and let’s do it together,” said Mkhize.
