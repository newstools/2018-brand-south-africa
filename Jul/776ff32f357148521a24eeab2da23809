Johannesburg, Monday 16 July 2018 – As we commemorate Nelson Mandela’s Centenary this month, the country is reminded of some of Mandela’s passions that unify citizens and contribute towards building a better world for all, one of which is sport. In the words of the great statesman, “Sports have the power to change the world. It has the power to inspire, the power to unite people in a way that little else does. It speaks to youth in a language they understand. Sports can create hope, where there was once only despair. It is more powerful than governments in breaking down racial barriers.” Brand South Africa congratulates our sports women and men for their sporting achievements over the weekend. Sport is a great way of building the image and reputation of the nation brand and its attractiveness on a global stage. It is with this notion that the importance of good performance in sport is acknowledged as a positive construct to position the nation brand for competitive advantage. “Thank you team South Africa, the country’s prowess in sport is and continues to reach great stature because of your dedication”, said Brand South Africa’s Chief Marketing Officer Mrs Linda Magapatona-Sangaret. Some of the weekend sporting achievements include; “It is truly fitting that our sports men and women did us proud during Mandela service month, when we are all urged to be the legacy. I believe there are many young people who have been encouraged to persevere and chase their dreams. Brand South Africa hails all South Africans who represented us across the globe, this past weekend” adds Mrs Magapatona-Sangaret.
