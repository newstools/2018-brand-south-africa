Mrs Mpumalanga second runner-up 2017 – Lucia Ochan, is playing her part whilst in the running for the prestigious crown of Mrs Africa 2019. As a prominent businesswoman, founder and patron of the Lucia O Foundation. Mrs Ochan is making strides towards a better future for all in her community, this through her Emphakatsi – INdlovukati (She Elephant) – Women in leadership and rural women empowerment series project. The project will be launched in partnership with rural women in order to uplift, empower and develop the community positively. “The reality is that many rural people are rendered second-class citizens in their own countries,” said Ochan, adding, “They are often far removed from urban economic nodes and live under extreme measures of poverty often without basic amenities such as clean drinkable water, sanitation, housing, electricity, schools, etc.” The launch will consist of a Creative Masterclass for upcoming young fashion designers (youths between the ages of 18-26) in the morning and provide insights into the clothing, textile and jewellery industry.
