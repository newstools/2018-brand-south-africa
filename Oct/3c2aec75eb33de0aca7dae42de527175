5 December 2017 marks the day former President Nelson Mandela passed away at his home in Houghton four years ago. People from South Africa and around the world have taken to social media to share their memories of Nelson Mandela, showing appreciation for his life’s work in ushering South Africa into a new era. 5 December 2017 marks exactly four years since former president Nelson Mandela passed away at his suburban home in Houghton Johannesburg in 2013. The Anniversary of his passing has led thousands of people in South Africa and across the world to take to social media to pay their respects to the man who is regarded by many as the ‘Father of a nation’, both celebrating his life and mourning his death. Few, if any, have played such a pivotal role in transforming a nation and uniting a people as diverse as those in the rainbow nation, and it is because of this, amongst many other great and endearing achievements, that Mandela remains in the hearts of people around the world. Here are but a few of the sentiments shared by people looking back on his life and how the elderly statesman came to be a global icon and a legend in his own right. “Death is something inevitable. When a man has done what he considers to be his duty to his people & his country, he can rest in peace. I believe I have made that effort & that is, therefore, why I will sleep for the eternity” #NelsonMandela pic.twitter.com/QRq1JNWp5H — NelsonMandela (@NelsonMandela) December 5, 2017  I remember this day so well. 4 years ago lighting candles outside President Nelson Mandela’s home in honour and mourning.
