Johannesburg, Tuesday 27 March 2018 – Brand South Africa through the Play Your Part programme is collaborating with various stakeholders provincially and nationally, to deliver the road safety awareness campaign on the 28th March in Mpumalanga ahead of the Easter season. The stakeholders include Sasol, Govan Mbeki Local Municipality and the Black Management Forum. Brand South Africa understands the impact of negative road safety statistics on the Nation Brand and therefore, the objective of this collaboration is to encourage citizens to play their part and exercise positive road safety habits in order to positively project the image of the Nation Brand. This collaboration is in line with Brand South Africa’s the Play Your Part programme to interact with road users and promote road safety ahead of Easter, when many will be on the roads to various destinations in the country. “We have been pushing the road safety message with various stakeholders throughout the country as it is imperative that citizens are constantly reminded of their role in protecting one another on the roads especially during these busy times. Our key message through the Play Your Part programme is “PLAY YOUR PART AND BE SAFE”, said Brand South Africa’s Stakeholder Relations Manager for Government, Ms Toni Gumede.
