Over the course of the season viewers saw a wide variety of people doing extraordinary things for the benefit of South Africa. Viewers saw the pillars of Active Citizenship, Social Cohesion, Youth Development, Women Empowerment, Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Skills Development being promoted. Each of these pillars could stand on their own, but the foundation on which they stand is education. Education is not just about going to school and getting a degree. It’s about widening your knowledge and absorbing the truth about life.
