Commenting on the campaign, Brand South Africa’s CEO, Dr Kingsley Makhubela said: “This campaign comes at a time which sees private and public sector in collaborative efforts to strengthen  and accelerate  progress in building a more prosperous and equitable South Africa. “For this campaign, we took a word of mouth approach with private sector CEOs, as it is a critical indicator in influencing business decisions to invest in any country. This translates to how their respective organisations then contribute and respond to South Africa’s economic growth and development”. Follow the conversation on  #CompetitiveSA
